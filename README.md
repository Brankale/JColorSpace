# ðŸŒˆ lib ColorSpace ðŸŒˆ

This library lets you create new ColorSpaces and perform conversions between them.

## Special thanks

I would like to really thank:
- the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorSpace) from which the architecture of the library is highly inspired.
- Bruce Justin Lindbloom for his awesome [website](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/) from which I took the formulas.

Without them this project wouldn't have been possible.
